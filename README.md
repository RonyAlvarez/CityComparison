# CityComparison
This is my first php application.

This is a simple application for comparing US cities. The app is almost finished, I just need to fix the responsiveness because I did not designed it for mobile first, and now I am having a hard time trying to fix my mistake. I sure learned my lesson and from now on will develop for mobile first.

I think I will change the desing a little first, because I am satisfied with the result but I am not happy.
